Combine and Crack PCAP


Sometimes when you get dumped with so many pcap files that we just want to run a tool and come back when everything's done.

This tool accepts the folder containing your pcap files, as well as directories where your wordlists are.

Just edit the ccpcap.sh file, change permission, run and come back when it's done.
